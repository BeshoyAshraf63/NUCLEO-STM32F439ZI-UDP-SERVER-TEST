# NUCLEO-STM32F439ZI-UDP-SERVER-TEST
This is an application design to send data to UDP server (board itself) of address 192.168.1.7 and port number=7
.When data recieved = "OPEN" --> all 3 leds turns on.
.When data recieved = "CLOSE" --> all 3 leds turns on.
.Otherwise the reply comes in form of HELLO (recieved data) FROM UDP SERVER
